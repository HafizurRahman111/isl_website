Developing a website for Idea Solutions Limited. It has offered a comprehensive range of telecom and IT services, including VAS, mobile &amp; web apps, software design, graphic design, and various SMS services since 2014. Idea Solutions Limited is connected with 5 Mobile operators of Bangladesh, and our versatile short code for all these five operators is 16404 though we maintain other different short codes with these operators. Let me also mention here that we have offered around 50+ SMS-based services in Bangladesh, and I believe it proudly announces Idea Solutions as one of the unique content Aggregators/integrators and solution providers of the country. We also provide RBT content and GPRS/WAP-based rich content. Being driven by our reputation, The Mobile Operators have chosen Idea Solutions Ltd again and again to be the SMS/MMS carrier and Solution provider for their Banded services. Thereby Idea Solutions holds the record of handling vast numbers of daily SMS Traffic to the tune of a hundred thousand. We believe that we have the most robust, reliable, and redundant technical infrastructure compared to other Content carriers, and our technology is a seamless integration of Industry leader hardware (IBM Servers) and Software (Unix, Oracle) components.
